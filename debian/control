Description: parallel bzip2 implementation
 pbzip2 is a parallel implementation of the bzip2 block-sorting file
 compressor that uses pthreads and achieves near-linear speedup on SMP
 machines. The output of this version is fully compatible with bzip2
 v1.0.2 (ie: anything compressed with pbzip2 can be decompressed with
 bzip2).
